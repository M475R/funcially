## Downloading
- Desktop Version (Windows + Mac) available in the `Releases` Tab
- Web Version available [here](https://david072.github.io/calculator)!

## Features

- GUI and CLI applications
- Literals in decimal, hex and binary
    - The integer part of floats can be omitted
- Basic operators (`+ - * /`)
- Extended operators (`^`, Bitwise operators, ...)
- Groups and nested groups (`(2 + 2) * 2`)
- Functions (such as `sin` or `cos`)
    - Custom Functions (`f(x) := 3x`)
- Variables
    - Builtin variables such as `pi` or `e`
    - `ans` variable, holding the result of the last computation
    - Custom variables (`x := 3 + 4`)
- Inferred multiplication before groups, functions and variables (`2pi`)
- Number modifiers (such as `!` for factorial or Bitwise NOT or `%` as a shorthand for `n / 100`)
- `of` operator for taking a percentage from a number
- Equality checks (`4 = 2 * 2`)
- Units
    - Unit suffixes such as (`m`, `lb` or `Â°C`)
    - Unit prefixes such as (`k` (Kilo), `g` (Giga), or `m` (Milli))
- `in` operator
    - Conversion between units
    - Conversion between representations (if last thing in line)
- Plotting single argument functions in the GUI
- Web version + PWA (downloadable website)

### Order of operations

1. Functions and variables
2. Groups
3. Extended operators
4. Multiplication and division
5. Addition and subtraction
6. `of` and `in`

## Building

1. Clone the project with `git clone https://github.com/david072/calculator`
2. `cd calculator`
3. Run the CLI version with `cargo run --bin cli` or the GUI version with `cargo run --bin gui`

While it should also work on Linux, it has only been tested on Windows and Mac so far.

## TODO

- Complex units such as `km/h`
- Constructs such as the unit `W` being constructed from the units `V` and `A`

## Contributing

You can contribute either by using the application and reporting issues and submitting feature requests,
or by forking the project and working on it yourself.
